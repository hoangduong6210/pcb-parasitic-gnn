# Live Execution Snapshot

Last scheduler observation: 2026-08-20 02:48 UTC.

| Stage | State | Coverage | Active work | Anomalies |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| FEM-R3P16 | `VALIDATED` | 1,500 of 1,500 accepted | None | Four missing final-array elements recovered as hash-pinned singletons |
| FEM-R4P16 | `VALIDATED` | 198 of 198 accepted | None | One scheduler-preflight miss recovered as a hash-pinned singleton |
| Joint finalizer | `FINALIZED` | 1,698 long-form observations | None | First submission used a wrong helper path; corrected submission completed |
| R3/R4 discrepancy audit | `COMPLETED` | 198 of 198 pairs across 66 families | None | First job failed closed when site policy allocated 3 CPUs for a 2-CPU request; the corrected gate distinguished requested and allocated resources |
| Corpus V4 accuracy training | `RUNNING` | 0 of 25 checkpoints accepted; first five cells entered training | Array `6902756`; wait for terminal accounting, then build the accepted/pending set | Initial array `6902623` failed closed before training; the corrected resource gate now passes on compute |

The successful finalizer closed 1,500 R3 observations and 198 R4 observations
over 1,500 unique geometries. Its output keeps fidelity identifiers explicit.
It does not call either fidelity ground truth, mesh-converged, or physically
validated.

## Why R4 took longer

For the matched layout 717, R3 used 2,062,878 nodes, 12,477,301 tetrahedra,
18.565 GiB peak memory, and 528.949 s. R4 used 9,241,959 nodes, 56,742,824
tetrahedra, 83.240 GiB, and 3,460.433 s. On this layout, R4 increased the mesh
by about 4.5-fold and wall time by about 6.5-fold. This pair illustrates cost;
it is not reported as a corpus median.

The source artifacts are indexed under `E-C4-RUN-02`; complete execution and
finalization closure are indexed under `E-C4-RUN-01` and `E-C4-FINAL-01` in the
[Evidence Ledger](../evidence/Evidence-Ledger.md).

## Next transition

The downstream loader, deterministic plan, execution lock, clean execution
commit, scheduler test-only gate, and compute-node resource gate have passed.
The 25 crossed training cells now run as checkpoint-only tasks. Completion of
the array will not by itself admit an accuracy statement: the accepted-set planner
and SLURM finalizer must first reconstruct exact coverage and all matrices. The
completed discrepancy audit admits no runtime headline by itself.
